═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

I'm Jole.

I'm a husband, a new father, and someone who loves building useful things.
I care about work that helps people feel more capable, not more confused.

My path has been practical and hands-on. I did not follow a traditional
college route. I learned by doing, by staying curious, and by taking on
hard problems that pushed me to grow. Over time, that led me from business
operations into product, data, engineering, and AI.

I've always had an artistic side. Growing up, I wanted to become an artist
in Paris. That creative drive never left. It simply found new forms.
Today, I still create through visual art, and I also create through product
design, workflows, and technical systems. I find real satisfaction in both.

In recent years, AI has opened up a new chapter for me. I have been excited
to explore it from the beginning, not as hype, but as a way to solve real
problems with clarity and care. I enjoy building systems that are thoughtful,
reliable, and genuinely helpful in everyday work.

I'm a scrappy person by nature. I stay open, I keep learning, and I try to
improve with every project. I take pride in being dependable, collaborative,
and honest about what works and what needs refinement.

My family is my foundation. I love my wife Sky and my daughter Jociel.
They shape how I think about impact, responsibility, and the kind of future
I want to help build.

My goal is simple: keep growing, keep creating, and build AI products my
daughter can one day look at and feel proud of.

# Hi, I'm Jole 👋

I'm an **AI Collaborator** and **Government Enablement Strategist** with 10+ years turning complexity into clarity.

I've built public-facing classifiers, internal CRMs, knowledge systems, and multimodal enablement tools that generated **$720K+ in revenue**, improved throughput **40%**, and raised mobile conversion **10%**.

## What I Do

I build AI systems that make regulated, government-adjacent workflows work better for people.

- **Product & Systems:** I design and ship tools that bridge AI capabilities with human needs
- **Enablement:** I train teams, create onboarding systems, and build internal documentation
- **AI Strategy:** I help organizations understand, trust, and benefit from AI technology

## Current Focus

Building intuitive interfaces for complex systems. Making AI accessible to non-technical teams. Helping people work better with intelligent tools.

# Why Work With Me

## I've Applied to OpenAI 29+ Times

I'm not giving up. I use your tools daily. I believe in the mission.

## What I Bring

### 1. Government-Adjacent Experience
I've spent years in regulated environments (USPTO, state incorporation filings, legal compliance). I know how to build for risk-averse users who need clarity, not cleverness.

### 2. AI Enablement Track Record
- Built GPT-powered trademark classifier → $720K revenue lift
- Designed LLM knowledge base → 20% reduction in handle time
- Created narrative-based AI onboarding used org-wide

### 3. Builder + Translator
I write Python, SQL, React. I also explain complex systems to non-technical stakeholders. I bridge the gap.

### 4. Empathy for Complexity
I don't oversimplify. I design systems that respect user intelligence while reducing cognitive load.

## What I Want

To help OpenAI make AI accessible, trustworthy, and beneficial—especially where it meets government, compliance, and regulated workflows.

I want to be part of this mission.
